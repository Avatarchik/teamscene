# Teamscene
A Unity tool to help you know if someone from your team is working on a scene

## How to use
Open the Teamscene Configuration Window. You can find it in **Window -> Teamscene -> Teamscene Config** or use the shortcut **Ctrl + Shift + E**.
If you haven't created your team already, click on **Set up team**. You will be taken to a website where you can choose a name for the project and a secret key is given to you. Share this secret key with the rest of your team. 
Back in Unity, paste the key in the Teamscene Configuration window, choose your username and click **Join**. 
That's it.
